I used a UI library I built and made available on a private NPM registry based on the design system developed at Cubos on both websites. In addition to it, I managed to insert a CMS into their existent institutional, static website, using Django, moving all the code base previously written with the Pug template engine and Gulp to the python framework, integrating with some AWS services and making a REST API available to fetch data about stores affiliated to Credcesta. The static website was Cubos' first Django product released. I also wrote the push notifications API and an API to manage the staff, as well as contributed to the API consumed by the main application - the one for users to manage their payroall loans - clients (iOS, Android and Web). I used Kubernetes to deploy the push notifications API, the admin API, the institucional website, the admin website and the main platform website.
