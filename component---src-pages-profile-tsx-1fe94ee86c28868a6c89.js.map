The CMS' frontend relies on the Material UI design lib,\n              while the E-commerce design system was built in house. They were\n              moving from a third party CMS to their own CMS, and from one\n              payment gateway to another. We were assigned to make that\n              transition happen: a team of eight people - a project manager, a\n              QA analyst, four backend developers and two frontend developers.\n              The e-commerce welcomes 100k monthly users.\n            </P>\n            <P>\n              Credcesta is a payroll loan platform implemented in the state of\n              Bahia, Brazil, for clients and the business owners. Credcesta was\n              moving its credit card from a private label to Visa. That move\n              required big changes. I maintained the website for users to manage\n              their payroll loans while working on its redesign and expansion.\n              Besides that, I built the website for the Credcesta staff to\n              manage themselves, visualize data related to the main platform\n              usage, and send push notifications to their clients. I used a UI\n              library I built and made available on a private NPM registry based\n              on the design system developed at Cubos on both websites.

The static website is Cubos'\n              first Django product ever released. I also wrote several\n              micro-services: a push notifications API, an authentication API,\n              an audit API, and an API to manage the staff, not speaking of the\n              API consumed by the main application - the one for users to manage\n              their payroll loans - clients (iOS, Android and Web) and its 40k\n              monthly users. We used Kubernetes to deploy every micro service,\n              the institucional website, the admin website and the main platform\n              website, as well as Firebase to deploy the admin website on a\n              development and a Q.A. environment. The team grew steadily from\n              the beginning, and I was the only frontend developer from\n              September/2019 to April/2020. The team peaked at August/2020 when\n              we were a team of twelve: three Android developers, two iOS\n              developers, one designer, one QA analyst, three backend developers\n              and two frontend developers, with myself having a full stack role,\n              and being the lead developer of my stacks and a squad leader.
