        in developing innovative features and enhancing user experiences. Before
        VTEX, I honed my skills building software for various sectors including fintech,
        edtech, and ecommerce. As a passionate problem-solver, I founded and currently
        maintain
        <LinkButton href="https://eutiveumsonho.com" target="_blank">

        </LinkButton>, a unique social network centered around dreams (the ones
        we have while sleeping). When I'm not delving into code or dreaming up
        the next big tech solution, you'll find me immersing myself in sports or
        spending quality time with friends.

            <li>I played a significant role in implementing the new Admin version redesign, which substantially enhanced VTEX's product appeal. Its state-of-the-art design greatly eased the selling process for VTEX.</li>
            <br />
            <!-- Link to Global Search, Admin GPT, cost reduction. -->
            <li>I spearheaded numerous product discoveries that led to vital product developments that optimized our system efficiency and user interface.</li>
            <br />
            <!-- Link to frontend observability post. -->
            <li>I was instrumental in creating and maintaining a micro-service to ingest observability data from frontend clients, enabling various teams to have a better understanding of their applications' performance and make data-driven decisions to improve their products.</li>
            <br />
            <li>I took measures to bolster system security by instrumenting the Admin services and creating alarms and dashboards. These tools significantly improved our responsiveness and accuracy during system outages, thereby minimizing downtime and maintaining high service quality.</li>
            <br />
            <li>I equipped the application with analytics data ingestion which generated valuable insights into product usage for the team.</li>
            <br />
            <!-- Write a lot about this topic -->
            <li>My explorations into micro-frontend architecture and frontend cloud technologies led to the creation of complex MVPs (Minimum Viable Products). These MVPs proved instrumental in guiding key decisions aimed at bolstering system efficiency and improving the developer experience.</li>
            <br />
            <!-- CLIs, crontabs, etc. -->
            <li>I also developed a suite of internal tools designed to automate mundane tasks, thereby boosting efficiency and productivity across various teams. These tools not only streamlined daily operations but also generated valuable insights that were utilized by product managers, designers, and engineers for refining product offerings.</li>

It serves as a playground for me to continually refine my technical skills and explore innovative ideas.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Despite not being primarily intended for mass user acquisition, the network has organically grown to over 100+ users, with more than 200+ dreams recorded, demonstrating its appeal and user-friendly design.</li>
            <br />
            <li>I've incorporated robust metrics tracking and system health monitoring capabilities to ensure the network's reliability and to glean insights into user behavior and engagement.</li>

            <li>I spearheaded the implementation of Fitdance's ecommerce frontend, orchestrating a comprehensive transition from the storefront to the backoffice. This strategic migration led to the streamlining of their operations onto a more efficient platform.</li>

            <br />
            <li>I played a pivotal role in creating Credcesta's portal, enabling customers to create credit cards and manage their accounts seamlessly. This crucial development facilitated the expansion of Credcesta's payroll loans program.</li>

            <li>My role extended to a migration of their constitutional website to Django. This transition empowered non-technical users to modify the website interface, improving accessibility and usability.</li>
