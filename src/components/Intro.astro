  <h1>Hi, I'm Marcelo! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a versatile{" "}

    platform. Since joining VTEX in late 2020, I've been instrumental in developing
    innovative features and enhancing user experiences. Before VTEX, I honed my skills
    building software for various sectors including fintech, edtech, and ecommerce.
    As a passionate problem-solver, I founded and currently maintain

    , a unique social network centered around dreams (the ones we have while sleeping).
    When I'm not delving into code or dreaming up the next big tech solution, you'll
    find me immersing myself in sports or spending quality time with friends.
