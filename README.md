This is the source code of my personal website, [marcelovicentegc.com](https://marcelovicentegc.com), containing my professional experience information. It is built with Astro and hosted on Vercel. There is no secret sauce here, just a simple static site with a single page.

If you want to have your own version of this website, you can fork this repository and customize it as you wish.

Here are the development commands:
